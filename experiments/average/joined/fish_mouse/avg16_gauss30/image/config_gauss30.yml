### EXperiment configuration
# If specified, training will be continued from this checkpoint
TRAIN_NETWORK_PATH: "best.net"
# If set to yes, the training process will write data to tensorboard
WRITE_TENSORBOARD_DATA: yes
# If set to yes, the network stores an example prediction every STEPS_PER_EPOCH

PRED_NETWORK_PATH: "best.net"
# Path where to store denoised images, can be "" to omit storing prediction results
